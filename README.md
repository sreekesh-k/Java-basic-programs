    1. WAP with two functions to check for an integer palindrome. 
    (Function1 should reverse the integer. Function2 should return 1,if it is a palindrome or else 0.)

    2. WAP to display numbers from m to n using single while loop.

    3. WAP to find the sum of the series 1+(1+2)+(1+2+3)+............ +(1+2+3+…+n) using a single while loop.

    4. WAP to find the sum of 1+2/2!+3/3!+4/4!++n/n! using a single for loop.
   
    5. WAP to calculate area of a circle (functions with no argument and no return type.)
   
    6. WAP to reverse a number (functions with argument and no return type.)

    7. WAP to calculate sum of digits of a number (functions with argument and return type.)

    8.  WAP to calculate sum of n even numbers (functions with no argument and return type.)

    1. WAP with nested functions to find the maximum of three numbers. 
      Function1 should take in two arguments and find the maximum.
      Function2 should take in the third number and the maximum from function1 to find the maximum.)

    2. WAP to find the factorial of n, using recursion.

    3. WAP to display numbers from n to 1 and vice versa, using recursion.

    4. Using constructors, implement the operations of a queue.

    5. Create a class complex having a real and imaginary part. Provide functions for read,
      display, add and multiplying two complex numbers.

    6. WAP to display even numbers upto ‘n’ using a static function.

    1.WAP (menu driven) to demonstrate method overriding in java, by displaying details of a student, and a teacher.

    2. Create a class for employee having eno,ename and esal as data members. Provide functions for reading and 
    displaying employee details. (Accept information of n employees in the main function, 
    display the same and search for an emp (using eno)).

    1. Program to implement run time polymorphism in Java using interface, wrt calculating area of a triangle.

    2.Create an interface Shape having two prototypes disp() and calc(),
    to diplay the shape and calculate volume respectively.
    Create two classes circle and rectangle which implements the above interface. 
    In the main function create a reference of Shape depending on the user-choice.

    3.WAP to implement a function using call by value to swap two float numbers.

    4. WAP to implement a function using call by reference to find the square root of a given number.
